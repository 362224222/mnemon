# Mnemon test observer

This directory contains a local-only, static evidence viewer for Harness test
runs. It is deliberately outside `daemon`, `authority`, `peerlink`, and
`selector`: displaying a record must never create or alter an R7 fact or an R8
preference.

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, then load one or more
`mnemon.test.trace` JSONL files with the file picker or drag-and-drop surface.
No server, package installation, build, network access, or browser storage is
required. The two synthetic `.trace` files under `fixtures/` exercise the R7
collaboration and R8 coloring views without masquerading as generated run
transcripts. The browser validates the closed record shapes, order, bounds,
backward-only causes, gate references, and exact SHA-256 footer before it
renders anything. A malformed or unverifiable file is rejected rather than
shown as partial evidence.

## What the five views mean

1. **Run integrity** shows the terminal trace status and explicit test gates.
   Missing evidence is `unknown` or `incomplete`, never an inferred pass.
2. **Agent turns** places runtime observations and machine effects in node
   lanes without treating model output as authority.
3. **Event causality** draws only recorded `causes` edges. Wall-clock order is
   not used to invent cross-node causality.
4. **Collaboration evidence** shows case-neutral connected components formed
   only by explicit backward `causes`. Bare Event, correlation, Delivery,
   Handling, and Reference tokens are annotations, not cross-node identity
   edges. The view does not assume a request/review/result workflow or invent
   missing stages. Terminal Handlings, Reference changes, and later Artifact
   reads are listed separately with their evidence class.
5. **R8 preference coloring** partitions evidence by exact SelectionID before
   displaying per-node colors and signed margins. Distinct selections are never
   overlaid or counted together. Every result remains a local preference, not
   consensus, finality, truth, completion, or an R7 Effect.

The observer is not an oracle. Test runners and independent validators produce
gate outcomes; the page only renders them.

Large traces remain valid inputs, but every visual surface has a fixed rendering
budget. When a lane, graph, component list, coloring round, or observation list
is truncated, the page says so explicitly and renders an exact sequence prefix.
Truncation never changes trace integrity or the reported test result.

## Trace contract

`trace-schema.json` is the closed JSON Schema for one JSONL record. A complete
file has exactly this shape:

```text
run header
fact 1
fact 2
...
fact N
result footer
```

Facts use a contiguous, runner-local `seq`. The observer recognizes cross-node
causality only through explicit backward `causes`, never through timestamps or
bare Event, correlation, Delivery, Handling, or Reference labels. Those labels
remain visible as annotations.
Every fact declares one evidence class:

| `truth` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `observation` | Runtime, transport, or runner observation; not authority |
| `accepted_local_fact` | A fact committed by one local R7 authority |
| `derived_projection` | A bounded view derived from committed state |
| `local_preference` | R8-local seed, color, round, or observation |
| `assertion` | Independent test-oracle result |

The schema also closes the relation between each known `kind`, its allowed
`source.class`, and its `truth` class. A runtime or transport observation cannot
rename itself as an accepted R7 effect; `r7.delivery.readmitted` is authored by
the receiving local authority after re-admission, not by transport. Every R8
fact must carry a SelectionID digest, which is the isolation boundary for
coloring and statistics.

The result footer covers the exact preceding JSONL bytes, including their line
terminators, with `trace_digest`. Its `record_count` counts only `fact` lines.
A missing footer, sequence gap, dangling trace cause, duplicate ID, count
mismatch, or digest mismatch makes a trace incomplete.

## Mandatory redaction

The schema is metadata-only. A conforming trace must not contain:

- prompts, messages, transcripts, model reasoning, or chain of thought;
- shell commands, command arguments, environment contents, or tool results;
- credentials, API keys, attachment credentials, private keys, or signatures;
- private operation keys, Artifact bytes, or unrestricted semantic payloads.

Allowed content is limited to bounded labels, stable references and digests,
counts, closed state names, timestamps, and protocol outcomes. Artifact content
remains in CAS and is represented only by digest, size, and structural role.

The HTML never inserts trace data as markup. Every untrusted label is assigned
through `textContent`; the page has no CDN, external asset, network request,
dynamic code evaluation, or persistence. If a future packer embeds a trace in
a self-contained report, it must use bounded base64 rather than placing JSON
inside a script element.

## Integration boundary

Runners may sanitize a runtime's temporary JSON stream into this schema before
destroying the raw stream. A test-only, read-only exporter may snapshot durable
R7 objects after a run and validate their canonical bytes. R8 test adapters may
emit round summaries that they already own. None of these paths may:

- add a daemon debug endpoint;
- write an authority or selector store;
- run in the admission transaction;
- make trace loss change a system fact;
- infer a successful gate from absent evidence.

Trace capture failure makes the test report `incomplete`. It does not roll back
or manufacture Event, Handling, Reference, Receipt, Delivery, or
PreferenceObservation state.

## Validation

Run the focused observer checks with:

```sh
go -C harness test ./test/observer
```

The complete Harness gate also includes this package through `go test ./...`.
The checks validate the schema asset, strict JSONL decoding, bounds,
redaction, trace linkage, footer digests, fixtures, Content Security Policy,
and the absence of external resources or markup injection APIs.
